<p>Dear Young 'Trep,<p>
<p>Being an entrepreneur is single handedly the most risky, testing and gut-wrenching venture anyone can take on.</p>
<p>You are essentially making the decision to go against the current that life wants to take you on and risking everything.</p>

<p>Being an entrepreneur means becoming so addicted to success that there is nothing anyone can say or do that will alter your drive.</p>

<p>You will fail...and you will fail again. But what keeps you going?</p>

<p>It is a unique will inside of you that stirs your drive, your grit and your tenacity to the point where you will not stop until you succeed.</p>

<p>There will be ups and downs, but it is how you react in the times your are down that defines who you are and whether
you will be successful.</p>

<p>No billionaire or successful entrepreneur ever got that way by taking the easy route.</p>

<p>No billionaire ever got that way because he sat behind his desk in his cubicle all day & accepted his paycheck every 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Being an entrepreneur means going against what feels natural and comfortable.</p> 

<p>You need to have a small amount of insanity stirring within your soul to be able to risk everything for success.</p>

<p>To outsiders looking in you may look crazy, because you are. They may not understand and they may question everything you do.</p>

<p>But as an entrepreneur this does not phase you. You stay motivated. You stay focused. You grind it out.
You roll with the punches and you keep moving forward at all costs.</p>

<p>Being an entrepreneur is saying "fudge it, I'm going for it and I'm not looking back." It is becoming so addicted to success that some days you can hardly sleep.</p>

<p>This type of life isn't for everyone. For most, the amount of stress and pain that comes along with failure is
too much to bear.</p>

<p>But it is what must be done if you are to experience true success. The most financially successful people in the world did not come to
be that way because a low-risk, guaranteed home run business opportunity just fell into their lap out of the sky. This story does not exist.</p>

<p>You stay focused, you stay strong, you stay driven and you keep the big picture and vision for the future at the
forefront of your mind at all times. Your vision is what keeps your wheels turning during times of doubt.</p>

<p>You will have days where you feel sick to your stomach. Days when you ask yourself "how did I even get here...
what am I even doing?"</p>

<p>Don't listen to that voice inside your head telling you to turn back around and take the safe route.</p>

<p>Every day you wake up you must risk everything. And risk it again the next day and again. A small bet never pays dividends 100 fold. Go all in and accept that the journey is the reward.</p>

<p><strong>Keep grinding no matter what life throws at you and above all else never ever quit.</strong></p> 
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Your Future Self</p>
