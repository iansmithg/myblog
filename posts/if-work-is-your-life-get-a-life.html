<p>I recently was browsing on TechCrunch and stumbled upon a compelling article offering a twist on the typical Work-Life Balance argument geared towards startup founders and small business owners.</p>

<p>The article can be summed up in the following two points:</p>

<p>1) Increase the amount of activities in your life that increase your productivity.</p>
<p>2) Decrease the amount of activities in your life that decrease your productivity.</p>

<p>Astonishing, right?</p>

<p>At first I was a bit taken back as this seemed like a very elementary and simplistic statement; Did this guy really spend his entire afternoon writing this seemingly meaningless post?</p>

<p>Yet despite my initial reaction I continued reading and what I found was amazingly helpful and has since re-shaped the way I view work-life balance. Take for example the simple logical 
argument containing two premises and a conclusion:</p>

<p>Premise 1: IF I participate in activities that decrease my stress level, THEN I will be more productive</p>
<p>Premise 2: IF I am more productive, THEN I am adding value to my startup.</p>

<p>Following the rules of classical logic thus brings us to the following conclusion:</p>

<p>Conclusion: IF I participate in activities that decrease my stress level, THEN I am adding value to my startup</p>

<p>I apologize if using the above logical argument came across as "beating a dead horse" but I do believe it serves a purpose. As small business owners and startup founders we are always 
told to BEWARE of falling into the deep, dark pit of having a poor work-life balance. The problem with this is when you own your own company there is no clear-cut black and white divider 
between your work and your life. You could be at dinner with your lovely girlfriend for Valentines Day and then BAMMM! You get smacked in the face with an email from a VIP client. 
Then all of a sudden your "life" life has just been blended into your "work" life without you even having a say in the matter.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my main point: You will NEVER have a traditional work-life balance if you are a small business owner or a startup founder. It is simply impossible.</p>

<p>And what I mean by "traditional" is: Work from 9am - 5pm and then do "life-stuff" from 5pm until you pass out while watching the weather channel.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is, when you are working on a startup every minute you spend that is not geared towards growing your business is a minute wasted. Right? 
You will never get that minute back. So it is wasted.</p>

<p>So what are us startup persons to do?! Our only solution is to change our psychology in how we view work-life balance. We have already established that as a startup 
founder there is no start-and-stop to our work days and weeks. It all blends together. So now are only option is to take the typical "life activities" 
(eating, exercising, sleeping, relationships, bowling, walking, running, playing pick-up basketball, reading, fishing, you name it!) and restructure them in our minds 
so that we see those activities as part of our job!</p>

<p>Let me reiterate: As a startup founder, the only way to have proper work-life balance is to view typical life activities as part of your job.</p>

<p>Implementing this into my own life has completely changed my life and the way I perceive spending time on activities that do not directly relate to my business.</p>

<p>Below I have listed 5 logical arguments (the shorthand versions) that I have applied to my own life which have greatly helped my personal "work-life balance".
They are all based on 5 activities that I have found decrease my stress level:</p>

<p><strong>1. Exercise:</strong> IF I exercise on a regular basis, THEN I will be less stressed, THEREFORE I will be more productive and add value to my business</p>

<p><strong>2. Maintaining Relationships:</strong> IF I allocate time to spend time with my friends and maintain strong relationships, THEN I will not feel alone on an island, 
THEREFORE I will be more confident and add value to my business</p>

<p><strong>3. Eating Properly:</strong> IF the majority of my meals are healthy unprocessed foods, THEN I do not feel lethargic and like I'm the stay-puffed marshmallow man, 
THEREFORE I will be more equipped to work and add value to my business</p>

<p><strong>4. Keeping a Weekly Schedule:</strong> IF I organize my tasks and meetings dates in a calendar, THEN I do not feel overwhelmed, THEREFORE I am more productive and add value to my business</p>

<p><strong>5. Getting Rest:</strong> IF I stay well-rested, THEN my brain is able to function properly, THEREFORE I am able to process information more quickly and accurately and add value to my business</p>

<p>What is the keyword in all of the statements? ADD VALUE TO MY BUSINESS.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, it is our job as founders to add value to our respective businesses. And if participating in activities that lower stress and make us more capable of performing 
our job, then what are we not doing more of these activities?</p>

<p>Start viewing these seeming "life-activities" as a part of your job, not as a part of your work-life balance, and you will be better off! I promise you.</p>
