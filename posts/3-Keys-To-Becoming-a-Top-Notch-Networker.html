<p>I can remember in my high school days and younger years in college the word "networking" was constantly being shoved down my throat. I specifically remember Googling "networking" to only become more confused as I read about telecommunication systems, computers exchanging data, etc. It wasn't until around my Junior year in college that I experienced the power of networking and realized the value forming professional relationships has in my own life and career.</p>

<p>If you are looking for quick-hitter tips on proper networking techniques and styles you won't find that here. <a href="http://money.howstuffworks.com/business/professional-development/10-networking-tips-people-hate-networking.htm#page=0" target="_blank" shape="rect">A quick Google should do the trick for that purpose.</a></p>

<p>Rather, below I have outlined 3 concrete tips that I have found helpful in my own endeavours and wish only to share them with you in hopes they may also help you.</p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;"><a href="the-best-networker-I-ever-met.html">P.S. If you want to hear the story of the best networker I ever met you need to check this out.</a></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 26pt;"><strong>1. Drink More Coffee</strong></span></p>

<p>No I am not suggesting that you go out and by a Mr. Coffee 12-cup Coffeemaker (<a href="http://www.mrcoffee.com/coffeemakers/" target="_blank" shape="rect">although they are pretty slick</a>). I am talking about getting out of your comfort zone and actually meeting with people, talking about what you are working on and asking them the same! What makes us so unique as humans is our ability to engage in deep rooted relationship.</p>

<p>Be comfortable with being uncomfortable. Take your eyes off your smartphone and look around. Every time you step out of your apartment is a networking opportunity to meet, discuss and collaborate with those around you.</p>

<p>I am a startup guy first. I love innovation, creation and all things tech however I also am very passionate about relationships. Why? Because there is no way I would be where I am today (a soon-to-be graduated engineer from a Big Ten school who rejected the security of an engineer's salary to work on a startup and create something from the ground up) if I had not started asking questions, meeting with people smarter and more experienced than myself and admitting to myself that I do not have all the answers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I was working in South Bend, IN once I realized this and most of the meetings I scheduled were in Cincinnati, OH. So every weekend for an entire summer I drove 4 hours down to Cincinnati for only a few meetings with local entrepreneurs. Then I would drive 4 hours back on Sunday night. Did I want to drive 4 hours after work on a hot Friday afternoon? Hell no. But I did. And that has made all the difference.</p>

<p>Get out there. Meet people. Drink coffee. Collect business cards. Create a network surrounding yourself so when you don't know the answer, you know exactly who to go to to find it.</p>

<p style="font-size: 26pt;"><strong>2. Be Intentional</strong></p>

<p>One of the most valuable pieces of advice I have ever received regarding networking is to be intentional. You should have an agenda seared into your brain of what you want to accomplish before every coffee date you take. In this way you can direct the conversation as you go to make sure you are discussing what you had originally intended. In the story above, my professor was only given 15 minutes to speak with the Author...he had to make the most of every minute to make an impression.</p>

<p>If you fail to do this you will end up sitting in Starbucks listening to the person across the table ramble on about Uncle Mike's record walleye fish he pulled out of Lake Erie two summers ago. Trust me. I've been there.</p>

<p>Always have an agenda. Except with family.</p>

<p>But don't take my word for it...I recently was able to connect with the Lead Software Engineer at UBER (if you have not heard of <a href="https://www.uber.com/en-US/" target="_blank" shape="rect">UBER</a> then I don't know what to tell you). He was actually the third guy on the team and did not even study Computer Science during his time in college. Below is what he said regarding meeting with people and his willingness to do so:</p>

<blockquote>
<div><em>"I get multiple general requests like this per week for coffees, phone calls, whatever, so the way I usually deal with them is to politely decline requests to just talk or meet, but offer that I'd be glad to answer specific questions or help with a specific request or favor. Usually people don't take me up on that (which would actually be more valuable for them) because they haven't thought through what they are trying to achieve and how they can leverage my willingness to be helpful. Just a tactic I've developed to be protective of my time and while still giving back to those in the same position of inexperience I was in when I was younger and full of ambition."</em></div></blockquote>

<p>WOW.</p>

<p>So you're telling me that the Lead Software Engineer at UBER actually prefers the people he meets with to be intentional?!</p>

<p>Hmmm...and notice not only does he prefer intentional networking and meetings, but he also describes his "willingness to be helpful". Pretty cool.</p>

<p>So before I spoke with him at all I first wrote out the 3 specific points I wanted to discuss and listed them at the beginning of our talk so we each knew exactly what we would be covering.</p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Intentional-Networker-Attracting-relationships-ebook/dp/B005RSYCHM" target="_blank" shape="rect">Be intentional</a>. Be effective. And always know what you want to achieve.</p>

<p style="font-size: 26pt;"><strong>3. Connect the Dots</strong></p>

<p>Who remembers the connect the dots game when you were in kindergarten? As a point of reference that was around the time when you were still trying to cut in a straight line (or maybe that was Pre-K...can't remember).</p>

<p>There would be a page filled with little black dots with small numbers beside each dot. You would then connect the dots starting from dot #1 and counting upwards making sure not to skip a number. If you successfully connected all the dots in the correct order you would create a cool picture! So much fun!</p>

<p>The reason I bring up that game is because I think it serves as a valuable metaphor. If you are looking for a TCF (technical co-founder) to help you build and code an app what are the chances you will meet your guy on your first sit down? Second sit down? Third?</p>

<p>The chances are slim to none. Honestly. Be resilient. Be persistent. If you know ahead of time that it will take time before you find the person that has the information you're looking for then you are already one step ahead of the game.</p>

<p>This way...you are now prepared to meet someone for coffee then shoot them a polite follow up email saying: "I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me about _____. If you have a few people in mind who you think I would benefit in talking to I would really appreciate it if you could connect me with them."</p>

<p>Connect the dots. Build a network surrounding yourself. The quicker you are able to do this the better off you will be. Below is a picture of my apartment wall once I finally realized the importance of connecting the dots and decided to start leveraging my connections.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or want to connect I encourage you to reach out to me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ian-smith/4b/842/37" target="_blank" shape="rect">LinkedIn</a> or follow me on Twitter!</p>

<p>Happy networking!</p>
