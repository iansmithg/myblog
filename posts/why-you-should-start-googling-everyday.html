<p>I spent this past weekend in the small town of Chagrin Falls in Northeast Ohio celebrating Memorial Day weekend. Everyone in the town 
knew everyone and would walk in and out of each others house at will...it was crazy! It was like a scene out of an old 60's movie that 
your mother made you watch with her because she wanted to spend "quality time" with you. But I digress...</p>

<p>I must have met over 30 people over the course of 48 hours. One person in particular that I met was named Rick...Rick was a typical 
guy born and raised in Chagrin Falls and had a beautiful house overlooking a a crystal blue lake. Rick and I shared some words over 
the course of the weekend until finally he asked me: "So Ian what kind of hobbies do you have?" It took me by surprise for a moment 
because I was expecting a question about mobile app development or about how Designli.co got started.</p>

<p>I thought for a moment and told Rick about how I love to play the acoustic guitar and golf....and about how I have recently taken 
up photography and about my continual learnings in graphic design and web development. During my trip home after the weekend had 
ended I had some time to reflect on my experience and all of the interesting people I had met. For some reason Rick's question was 
stuck in my head but I didn't know why. Until it hit me...</p>

<p>Every single "hobby" I currently have I taught myself through Google. Literally! Each one of my hobbies was born as a simple Google search.</p>

<p>There is no doubting the power of Google. I do not need to spend time selling you on that. But what I do want to explore are the benefits 
you can experience in your own life by choosing to Google on a regular basis. Every single day we have questions that pop into our heads...
I wonder how a car engine works? I wonder how to create a simple web page? I wonder how the apps on my iPhone are created?</p>

<p>Look, I get it. Your life is busy. You have more important and time sensitive things on your mind and don't have time to research 
questions that pop into your heads every waking moment. If this is you I suggest you read on. One of my long time mentors once told me 
"...if you want to be successful, know a little about a lot...not vice versa". Below I have listed 5 benefits of becoming a daily Google'r 
that will create immediate results in your life.</p>

<p style="font-size: 26pt;"><strong>1) Save Money</strong></p>
<p>Here's a fact...if you spent 30 minutes a day Googling how to build a brand new porch deck, you inevitably would know exactly how to build 
a porch deck. And when you know how to make a porch deck yourself...guess what you don't have to do? Pay someone else to do it. If you spend 
time teaching yourself how to DIY you are investing in yourself and saving money at the same time. So next time you are laying on the couch 
with your iPad on your lap after a long day at work...pull up your browser and start reading.</p>

<p style="font-size: 26pt;"><strong>2) Meaningful Small Talk</strong></p>
<p>How many times have you sat around the dinner table and had no idea what anyone was talking about? How many times have you been dragged to a 
dinner party only to be smacked in the face with awkward silences and pauses during your conversation with a complete stranger? I bet it has 
happened to you more than once. Everyone has their own niche of hobbies, activities, pastimes or projects at work that interests them. By 
Googling throughout the day and finding answers to your questions not only are you increasing your knowledge but you are increasing the chances 
you will find something you and a stranger have in common next time you engage in small talk.</p>

<p style="font-size: 26pt;"><strong>3) Networking</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of small talk...what a great networking opportunity small talk is! One of my long time mentors once suggested that I keep an agenda 
in the back of my mind every time I meet with someone new (with the exception of family members). By being knowledgeable and well-learned 
about a variety of subjects you are increasing the chances you will be able to hold a conversation with a stranger about a topic that interests 
you both. Next thing you know it, the man you were talking to takes a liking to you...he mentions that he is a lawyer...and now you have access 
to legal counsel free of charge!</p>
 
<p style="font-size: 26pt;"><strong>4) Your Personal Brand</strong></p>
<p>No one likes people who are ignorant. Do not be that person. Not that you are being ignorant on purpose...but sometimes we say things without 
thinking simply because we want to engage in the conversation people are having around us. By Googling on a regular basis you are expanding your 
brain and branding yourself as a well-educated and well-versed person...and that's good for me.</p>

<p style="font-size: 26pt;"><strong>5) Staying Sharp</strong></p>
<p>Above all else..Googling regularly enables you to stay sharp in between the ears. Our brains have a fixed lifetime before they start deteriorating 
and not working properly. If you don't train and exercise your brain regularly you are only hurting yourself. 
<a href="http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100923210150/simpsons/images/b/b4/Homer_drool.jpg">Don't end up like this guy.</a></p>

<p>So next time you are driving to work and a question pops into your head...don't it pass through your head. Park your car, make a memo note on your 
phone and Google it over your lunch break and expand your knowledge base. It will pay dividends in the future.</p> 

<p>Invest in yourself on a daily basis by Google-ing and you WILL see returns.</p>
