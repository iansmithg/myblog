<p>I once had a professor who taught my Entrepreneurial Finance course at Ohio State. For the sake of anonymity let's call him Professor Plum.</p>. 

<center><img class="img-responsive" src="../img/professor-plum.jpg" alt="" height="400px" width="200px"></center>

<p>At the beginning of every class period Prof. Plum would take out 2 books from his satchel that he recommended we read and talk about what lessons he took away from each book. He then would proceed to tell us a story from his past career as an investment banker on Wall Street. Below is one of my favorites...</p>

<p>As an analyst on Wall Street and fresh out of B-School Prof. Plum was constantly looking over lengthy business models and being flown all over the country doing the grunt work of the Senior VP's at his firm. Due to the amount of time he spent in the air he took a particular liking to reading books to pass the time.</p>

<p>On one trip to L.A. Prof. Plum realized the Author of one of the books he was reading actually lived and had a family in L.A. He quickly picked up the phone and called the Author's secretary to see if he could meet with him for before he caught his flight back to New York on Friday afternoon. Luckily he was able to meet with the Author for 15 minutes over coffee. Upon returning to New York Prof. Plum wanted to send the author a gift to thank him for his time....but not just any gift, something he would enjoy and remember. After picking up the phone and speaking with his Secretary again, he was told the Author had a particular liking for seafood.</p>

<p>To express his thanks, Prof. Plum bought 3 cans of Clam Chowder from his favorite (and coincidentally the most expensive) seafood restaurant on the East Coast totaling around $90 and sent them to the Author's office.</p>

<p>Did he have to send the Author Clam Chowder? No. But that simple act sparked a relationship that lasted for years to come. That one act allowed the Author to remember him as the "Clam Chowder Guy" for a brief time instead of just a name he would later forget. After Prof. Plum left Wall Street and became a college professor, that same Author who he spoke with for 15 minutes at a coffee bar in L.A. willingly spoke to Prof. Plum's classes at no cost every year (the Author's typical rate was between 25k - 40k).</p>

<p>That professor was one of the most effective networkers I had ever met. It doesn't get any better than that.</p>

<p><strong>The Key: Do nice things for others expecting nothing in return.</strong></p>

<p>If you do that....good things will happen.</p>
